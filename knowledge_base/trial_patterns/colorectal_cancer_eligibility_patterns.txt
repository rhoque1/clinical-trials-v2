Inclusion Criteria:

* Underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy at MGH within the last 9 months with removal of at least one adenoma.
* Age 18-80 years.
* This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults.

* ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)
* Not currently taking aspirin (any dose) within the last 6 months.
* The effects of aspirin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

* Pregnant or breastfeeding.
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because aspirin is an FDA Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with aspirin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with aspirin.
* Participant must be able to swallow pills.
* Participant is taking any anticoagulant agent (e.g. warfarin) or antiplatelet agent (e.g. clopidogrel).

* Presence of deficient (d) DNA mismatch repair (dMMR); MMR status must be assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR protein expression (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) where loss of one or more proteins indicates dMMR; dMMR may be determined either locally or by site-selected reference lab; Note: loss of MLH1 and PMS2 commonly occur together; formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue is required for subsequent retrospective central confirmation of dMMR status
* Patients with testing that did not show dMMR (loss of MMR protein) are not eligible to participate; patients whose tumors show MSI-H by PCR-based assay are not eligible to participate unless they also have MMR testing by IHC and are found to have dMMR (i.e. loss of one or more MMR proteins)

24. Full-dose oral or parenteral anticoagulants or thrombolytic treatment for therapeutic purposes ≤10 days prior to study randomization;
25. Geographic inaccessibility;
26. Any radiation therapy completed ≤ 4 weeks prior to study randomization. If the radiated lesion/s is/are the only site of disease, and if it/they show progression after the radiotherapeutic procedure, the patient will become eligible for the study;
27. Previous embolization or thermoablation of metastases ≤ 30 days prior to study randomization. If these lesions are the only site of disease, and if they show progression after the embolization or thermoablation procedure, the patient will become eligible for the study;
28. Laboratory abnormality or medical or psychiatric disorders that would interfere with informed consent or compliance, or which could indicate a contraindication to patient enrolment into the study (also known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficit);
29. HIV-positivity, whether or not symptomatic.
