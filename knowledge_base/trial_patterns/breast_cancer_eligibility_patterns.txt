* Patients may not have received \> 2 prior chemotherapies for advanced disease.
* Either measurable or evaluable disease is allowed.
* Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of ruxolitinib in participants \<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.

* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:
* Leukocytes ≥3,000/mcL
* Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL

* Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits
* AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
* Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal
* Both men and women are allowed.
* The effects of ruxolitinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

Phase I

* Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be eligible for admission into the study.

* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ruxolitinib is a JAK inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ruxolitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ruxolitinib. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
* Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
* Clinically significant malabsorption syndrome.
* Prior chemotherapy or radiation administered within 2 weeks from initiating study treatment.

**Phase:** PHASE2
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Interventions:** Mesna, Saline, Doxorubicin
**Biomarkers Mentioned:** ATM
**Age Range:**  to 
**Sex:** 

**Eligibility Criteria:**
Inclusion Criteria:

Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer or non-hodgkin lymphoma and independent of protocol eligibility be determined to require one of the chemotherapy regimens listed below

Participants must require as standard-of-care treatment a chemotherapy regimen that includes one of the following combinations:

* doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2;
* doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2;
* doxorubicin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (capped at 2 mg dose), and prednisone 100 mg +/- rituximab 375 mg/m2

Age \>18 years.Because these treatment regimens are rarely used in pediatric oncology, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2 trials.

Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

Zubrod performance score 2 or better.

Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

* leukocytes \>3,000/microliter (mcL) (unless due to cancer in marrow)
* absolute neutrophil count \>1,500/mcL (unless due to cancer in marrow)
* platelets \>100,000/mcL (unless due to cancer in marrow)
* total bilirubin \<1.5 X normal institutional limits
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)/Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) \<2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
* creatinine within normal institutional limits OR
* creatinine clearance \>60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal
* left ventricular function ≥ 50 % ejection fraction

Because the standard of care chemotherapy agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound the evaluation of neuro-cognitive outcomes.

History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to mesna or other agents used in the study (ie. sulfur containing drugs including "sulfa antibiotics" and celecoxib).

Patients requiring ongoing pharmacologic treatment of dementia are excluded.

Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the chemotherapy agents have known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with chemotherapy.

HIV-positivity is NOT a specific exclusion criteria.
