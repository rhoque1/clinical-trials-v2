* The effects of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial may have teratogenic potential, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately; men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) administration

* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents
* Patients on tacrolimus or any other immunosuppressants with significant interaction with cisplatin
* Patient who requires live vaccine administration
* Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

* Prior systemic chemotherapy for the current cancer (prior chemotherapy for a different cancer is allowed)

  * Myocardial infarction within the last 6 months
  * Unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia
  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) as a DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib); these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study
* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients with well-controlled disease, as determined by CD4 count and viral load, who are on antiretroviral therapy that does not contain a strong inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 are allowed on trial; HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy with strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions; patients with poorly controlled HIV are not eligible due to the increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy
* Definitive clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastasis or adenopathy below the clavicles
* M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

### Trial: NCT01469429
**Title:** Phase 1b Food Based Modulation of Biomarkers in Human Tissues at High-Risk for Oral Cancer.
**Phase:** PHASE1
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Interventions:** placebo, laboratory biomarker analysis, questionnaire administration
**Age Range:**  to 
**Sex:** 

**Eligibility Criteria:**
Inclusion Criteria:

* Eligible subjects includes all adult HN cancer patients who have been previously diagnosed with Stage 1-4 and in-situ squamous cell carcinoma within the past 36 months (mos); with or without further adjuvant therapy and have been determined to be disease free at the time of consent
* Patients must be able to take nutrition/medications orally

Exclusion Criteria:

* History of intolerance (including hypersensitivity or allergy) to berry or berry-containing products
* Inability to take oral nutrition/liquids or history of aspiration pneumonia

* Inability to grant informed consent
* Strict Vegetarians will be excluded from the study; it was found that consuming one portion per day of fruit or vegetables resulted in a significant decrease in oral cancer incidence; in those persons consuming multiple portions each day, there was a 50% reduction in risk; we assume that strict vegetarians will consume multiple portions each day of foods with chemopreventive activity and therefore inclusion of these individuals would have a negative impact on the study; there are several reports in the literature that herbal or multivitamin/mineral supplements have no effect on oral cancer incidence

Exclusion criteria:

* Prior invasive malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) unless disease free for a minimum of 3 years;

The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be significantly immunosuppressive.
