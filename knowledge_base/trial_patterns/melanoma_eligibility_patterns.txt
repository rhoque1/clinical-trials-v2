A multidisciplinary team will determine the appropriateness for resection via craniotomy and level of urgency for surgery of the MBM.
* Patient is on ≤4 mg/day dexamethasone or equivalent/day over pre-op period.
* Patients treated with prior monotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 are permitted.
* Treatment with BRAF MEK inhibitors (BRAF MEKi) (for example, dabrafenib / trametinib) is permitted as long as has been at least five half-lives or one week prior to study treatment, whichever is shorter.
* MRI with enhancing metastatic brain lesions (i.e., MBM) amenable to resection of contrast-enhancing tumor (determined by neurosurgeon). A multidisciplinary team will determine the appropriateness for resection via craniotomy and level of urgency for surgery of the MBM.
* Patient willing to undergo craniotomy and resection.
* Patient eligible for surgery in the 7-10 days after initial treatment.
* Patients who had prior surgical resection of MBM are eligible to enroll.
* Usual acceptable lab parameters, demonstrating adequate organ function as defined in protocol. All screening labs should be performed within 21 days of treatment initiation.

* A negative serum pregnancy test must be documented at the screening visit. Additionally, female patients must exhibit a negative urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours prior to the start of study drug, therefore the screening pregnancy test may need to be repeated prior to the start of study drug dosing. A urine pregnancy test can be used for this. A pre-dosing urine pregnancy test must be performed prior to each dose during study phase. A urine pregnancy test will also be conducted at End of Treatment Visit.
* Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in Section 13.1.2 Contraception Guidance for Female Participants of Child Bearing Potential.

**Eligibility Criteria:**
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant melanoma and clinical evidence of metastatic disease to the brain. Mucosal and ocular melanomas are included.
2. Untreated asymptomatic brain metastases ≤ 2 cm in maximal diameter, with mild or minimal edema, without associated hemorrhage or midline shift.
3. Progressing brain metastases of any size, not amenable to surgical resection and/or progressing through radiation therapy but without evidence of active associated hemorrhage. Treatment with bevacizumab may not be initiated until 4 weeks after surgical resection or radiation therapy completion.
4. Hemorrhagic metastases that have resolved after previous resection or radiation therapy do not exclude patients with new non-hemorrhagic metastases meeting the criteria described above from participating.

Patients must have measurable metastases to the brain, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \>10 mm in the brain MRI with gadolinium. For disease outside the brain, tumors must be \> 20 mm with conventional techniques or \> 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable disease outside the brain is NOT required.
6. Patients with any number of previous systemic therapies are eligible. Previous temozolomide treatment given on a different schedule is allowed, as long as it had not been given in combination with VEGF-targeting drugs.
7. Age \> 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of bevacizumab in patients \<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.
8. Life expectancy of 8 weeks or greater.
9. ECOG performance status \< 2 (Karnofsky \> 60%).
10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

    * Leukocytes \> 3,000/µl

      * Except for patients with known Gilbert's syndrome
11. The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because the anti-angiogenic agent used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with bevacizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
8. Otherwise well HIV-positive patients will be permitted to enroll on this trial.

* Patient/legal authorized representative (LAR) must be able to provide informed consent.
* Patient must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced unresectable stage III/IV or metastatic stage IV cutaneous or mucosal melanoma that has progressed on PD-1/PD-L1 therapy:

  o For Cohort A, the patient's melanoma must have progressed on prior PD-1 monotherapy
  * For Cohort B, the patient's melanoma must have progressed on prior combination PD-1 + LAG-3 blockade
  * Note: Intervening lines of targeted therapy, chemotherapy, bispecific (e.g. IMCgp100) and cell-based therapies are permitted between last ICI-based therapy and the start of study therapy
  * Note: For cohort A, peptide and mRNA vaccines may have been combined with PD-1 monotherapy as long as no other checkpoint inhibitors were concomitantly administered. For cohort B, peptide and mRNA vaccines may have been combined with combined PD-1 + LAG-3 blockade as long as no other checkpoint inhibitors were concomitantly administered Note: Prior PD-1 monotherapy (Cohort A) or PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade (Cohort B) may have been given in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting as long as progression is documented within 3 months of the final dose neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy
* Patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 o Note: Lesions previously injected with Talimogene laherparepvec or other local therapies may not be selected as target lesions unless they have demonstrated subsequent growth after injection

* Male study participants with WOCBP partners are required to use condoms unless they are vasectomized† or practice sexual abstinence.‡,§
* \* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.

  * Vasectomized partner or vasectomized study participant must have received medical assessment of the surgical success.

    * Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

      * Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.

* Prior Grade 3 or greater neurologic toxicity associated with a prior line of ICI therapy
* Any prior myocarditis associated with ICI therapy
* Concurrent systemic steroid therapy higher than physiologic dose steroid replacement (\>7.5 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), given within 14 days of starting treatment, or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of the start of treatment. Inhaled or topical steroids are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.
* Receipt of a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study medication
* Significant infection requiring systemic antibiotics within 2 weeks of the planned start of study medication (e.g., pneumonia, cellulitis)

Patients with controlled infections must undergo periodic monitoring of HBV DNA. Patients must remain on anti-viral therapy for at least 6 months beyond the last dose of investigational study drug.
  * Patients who are hepatitis C virus antibody positive (HCV Ab+) who have controlled infection (undetectable HCV RNA by PCR either spontaneously or in response to a successful prior course of anti-HCV therapy) may be enrolled into the study.
* Patients who are breastfeeding or who are pregnant as evidenced by a positive serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) performed within 14 days of the first dose of study drug.
* Prisoners or participants who are involuntarily incarcerated. (Note: Under certain specific circumstances where local regulations permit, a person who has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participant.)
* Participants who are compulsorily detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness (e.g., transmissible infection)

======================================================================
## PHASE4 TRIALS (1 trials)
======================================================================

### Trial: NCT00075166
**Title:** Surgery Versus Radiosurgery to Treat Metastatic Brain Tumors
**Phase:** PHASE4
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Interventions:** Stereotactic surgery (SRS), Craniotomy
**Biomarkers Mentioned:** ATM
**Age Range:**  to 
**Sex:** 

**Eligibility Criteria:**
INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients must:

1. be 21 years of age or older.
2. have a histologically confirmed primary malignancy.
3. be able to undergo an MRI scan of the brain.
4. have one to three intraparenchymal brain metastases as identified on a brain MRI scan with intravenous contrast.
5. have contrast enhancing tumor(s) that are well circumscribed and less than or equal to 4.0 cm in any dimension.
6. be appropriate for either procedure as determined by both a neurosurgeon and a radiation oncologist.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients must not:

1. have tumor(s) in the midbrain, pons, or medulla - patients undergoing surgical resections in these areas are highly likely to develop significant neurological deficits or death.
2. have tumors within 10 millimeters of the optic apparatus (nerves and chiasm) or the area postrema - patients undergoing SRS to these areas are at significant risk of developing permanent blindness or intractable nausea.
3. be poor operative candidates from an anesthetic point of view secondary to other major medical illnesses - the risk of undergoing general anesthesia outweighs the potential benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain metastasis.
4. have a coagulopathy demonstrated by an abnormal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less that 150,000 platelets/mm3) - the risk of developing uncontrollable intra-operatively bleeding outweighs the potential benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain metastasis.
5. have radiographic or cerebrospinal fluid specimen evidence of widespread leptomeningeal metastasis - neither surgery nor SRS is a useful treatment modality for this condition.
6. significant psychiatric impairments which, in the opinion of the investigators, will interfere with the proper administration or completion of the protocol - self explanatory.
7. acute or untreated infections (viral, bacterial or fungal) - patients with active infections are highly likely to have spread of their infections to the brain as a result of a craniotomy.
8. be pregnant at the time of the randomized treatment - general anesthesia and surgery may subject the fetus to unacceptable risks. Also, the NIH does not offer full obstetrical services in the event that medical care to the mother and/or fetus is required. Pregnant women presenting with brain metastases will be referred to facilities offering OB/GYN services.
9. be prisoners or other institutionalized individuals - these individuals are at risk of being susceptible to undue influences to participate in a research protocol against their free will.
10. have a diagnosis of germ cell tumor, lymphoma or small cell lung cancer - these tumors are highly radiosensitive and should therefore be treated with radiation.
11. have any of the following: aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or auto defibrillator, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body or implant \[e.g. metal shavings, retinal clips\], or insulin pump as these items would be contra-indications to undergoing an MRI scan.
12. have an allergy to iodine or shellfish or have previously had an allergic reaction to iodinated-contrast agents as this is a contra-indication to undergoing a contrast enhanced CT of the brain - a contrast enhanced CT of the brain is required for the planning of SRS.
