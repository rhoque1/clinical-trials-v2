* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated
* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load
* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible with 1 day washout for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and 2 weeks washout for whole brain radiation (WBRT)
* Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) are eligible if the treating physician determines that immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is unlikely to be required during the first cycle of therapy

* Patients must have the ability to ingest and retain oral (PO) medications
* The effects of the combination of sotorasib (AMG-510) and DS-8201a (T-DXd) on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because HER-2-directed antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must agree to use dual methods of contraception and must have a negative serum pregnancy testing at screening. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Women treated or enrolled on this protocol must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception, if sexually active, or avoid intercourse during the study treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of study drug. Sotorasib (AMG-510) may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method on study and for an additional 7 days after the last dose of sotorasib (AMG-510). Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use a highly effective barrier method of contraception, if sexually active, or avoid intercourse throughout the duration of the study and for 4 months following the last dose of study drug. To prevent exposure of the unborn child to sotorasib (AMG-510) through semen, male subjects will be required to practice true sexual abstinence (not have sex) or must wear a condom during vaginal sex
* Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous follicle-stimulating hormone \[FSH\] \> 40 mIU/mL and estradiol \< 40 pg/mL \[\< 147 pmol/L\] is confirmatory) are eligible. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status
* Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration. Preservation of sperm should be considered prior to enrollment in this study
* Female subjects must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after the final study drug administration
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Legally authorized representatives may sign and give informed consent on behalf of study participants

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients with a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease (ILD) that required steroids, has current ILD, or where suspected ILD cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening. These patients will be excluded because DS-8201a (T-DXd) is known to increase the risk of developing ILD and pneumonitis
* Patients with clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (i.e., pulmonary emboli within three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \[COPD\], restrictive lung disease, prior complete pneumonectomy), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis, etc.) where there is documented or a suspicion of pulmonary involvement or pneumonectomy at the time of screening. These patients will be excluded because DS-8201a (T-DXd) is known to increase the risk of developing ILD and pneumonitis
* Patients who have had chest radiation therapy within 4 weeks (2 weeks for palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy). These patients will be excluded because DS-8201a (T-DXd) and sotorasib (AMG-510) are known to increase the risk of developing pneumonitis
* Patients who have had a major surgery and are not yet fully healed from surgical incisions
* Patients who have had prior treatment with an antibody drug conjugate with a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor payload (i.e., sacituzumab govitecan, datopotomab deruxtecan, or trastuzumab deruxtecan) or with a topoisomerase inhibitor
* Patients with a history of significant lung disease requiring systemic corticosteroids treatment (\> 10 mg of prednisone daily) within the last six months of registration
* Based on pre-clinical data, DS-8201a (T-DXd) is associated with corneal disease. Patients with clinically significant corneal disease, in the opinion of the investigator, will be excluded from this study
* Patients with spinal cord compression, defined as untreated and symptomatic, or requiring therapy with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants to control associated symptoms
* Patients with an uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or antifungals
* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia. Subjects with chronic grade 2 toxicities (i.e., defined as no worsening to \> grade 2 for at least 3 months prior to first exposure to study intervention and managed with standard of care treatment) may be eligible per the discretion of the investigator after consultation with the sponsor medical monitor or designee (e.g., grade 2 chemotherapy-induced neuropathy). Subjects should no longer be symptomatic nor require treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone \> 10 mg or equivalent) or anticonvulsants and must have recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy
* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents
* Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to sotorasib (AMG-510), such as adagrasib, or DS-8201a (T-DXd)
* Patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to other monoclonal antibodies
* Patients who are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers should be switched to an alternative drug
* Avoid coadministration with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates for which minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities. If coadministration cannot be avoided, dose adjustment of the substrate may be required. Please refer to the prescribing information for the substrate
* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness or any other significant condition(s) that would make participation in this protocol unreasonably hazardous or interfere with the evaluation of the clinical study results
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because DS-8201a (T-DXd) is a HER2-directed antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a (T-DXd) breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a (T-DXd). These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study
* Patients with uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease (i.e., history of myocardial infarction within 6 months from screening, symptomatic congestive heart failure \[CHF\] \[New York Heart Association class II to IV\], troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction 28 days prior to enrollment, history of unstable angina, or serious cardiac arrhythmia)
* Patients with prior history of pneumonitis grade 2 or higher or ILD
* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial
* Patients unable to receive both iodinated contrast for CT scans and gadolinium contrast for MRI scans
* Patients that have pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion that requires drainage within 2 weeks of study screening procedures, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy (CART)
* Patients that have received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug will be excluded. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies, bacillus Calmette- Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (eg, FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed
