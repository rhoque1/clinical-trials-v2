**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
These are patients in whom a benign or malignant tumor was recorded requiring surgery. During that surgery, the surgeon will cut away the tumor as part of the treatment of the disease. In this process, it is important that the tumor is removed correctly and completely. To verify that the correct tissue was completely removed, the tissue is examined microscopically. However, a microscopic analysis takes a relatively long time and the result is not known until a few days after the surgery is compl

Recent 2015 ESGE guidelines provide precise recommendations for the use of ESD in the treatment of LNPS, but Italy lacks prospective data on the efficacy and safety of ESD in

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) belong to the sarcoma group and are characterized by oncogenic mutations in the c-KIT, PDGFRA, BRAF and NF-1 genes that drive tumor growth.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus R115777 in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining trastuzumab with R115777 may kill more tumor cells.

Claudin 18.2 protein, or CLDN18.2 is a protein found on cells in the digestive system. It is also found on some tumors. Researchers are looking at ways to attack CLDN18.2 to help control tumors.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Immunotherapy (IO), such as treatment with anti-PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 inhibitors, is a rapidly expanding treatment for multiple metastatic cancers with improved survival for certain cancers. However, the optimal duration of immunotherapies is currently unknown. Our hypothesis is that a reduced dose intensity of IO could be as effective as the current standard treatment in term of prevention of the disease progression. If proved right, this study will have a positive medico-economic impact by re

   Standard IO:

Continuation of IO at the same dose levels and rhythmicity until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or patient's choice.

   PREOPERATIVE THERAPY: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours, leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours continuously on d

**INTERVENTIONS:**
- DRUG: Oxaliplatin
- DRUG: Leucovorin Calcium
- DRUG: Irinotecan Hydrochloride

**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** HER2, ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age: 18 Years to

* Patients taking substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4 (CYP3A4) should be encouraged to switch to alternative drugs whenever possible, given the potential for drug-drug interactions with irinotecan
