**STUDY DESIGN:**
- Type: INTERVENTIONAL
- Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED
- Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP
- Primary Purpose: TREATMENT
- Masking: NONE
- Enrollment: 34 (ACTUAL)

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
This research is being done because melanoma in the brain is very difficult to treat because it does not respond to radiation or to chemotherapy, such as temozolomide. One of the reasons for this is that the melanoma can make chemicals that signal the brain to provide new blood vessels for the tumor. The main signal is called VEGF. Bevacizumab is an antibody that blocks VEGF. The investigators want to see if the combination of bevacizumab and temozolomide will stop the melanoma from growing.

**STUDY ARMS:** (1 arms)
1. Temozolomide/Bevacizumab (OTHER)
   Patients will be treated with a combination of temozolomide at 75 mg/m2/day for six continuous weeks, followed by a two-week rest period and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks without interruption. Cy

**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age: 18 Years to 90 Years
- Sex: ALL
- Healthy Volunteers: No

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
Inclusion Criteria:

1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant melanoma and clinical evidence of metastatic disease to the brain. Mucosal and ocular melanomas are included.
2. Untreated asymptomatic brain metastases ≤ 2 cm in maximal diameter, with mild or minimal edema, without associated hemorrhage or midline shift.
3. Progressing brain metastases of any size, not amenable to surgical resection and/or progressing through radiation therapy but without evidence of active associated hemorrhage. Treatment with bevacizumab may not be initiated until 4 weeks after surgical resection or radiation therapy completion.
4. Hemorrhagic metastases that have resolved after previous resection or radiation therapy do not exclude patients with new non-hemorrhagic metastases meeting the criteria described above from participating.
5. Patients must have measurable metastases to the brain, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \>10 mm in the brain MRI with gadolinium. For disease outside the brain, tumors must be \> 20 mm with conventional techniques or \> 10 mm with spiral CT scan. Measurable disease outside the brain is NOT required.
6. Patients with any number of previous systemic therapies are eligible. Previous temozolomide treatment given on a different schedule is allowed, as long as it had not been given in combination with VEGF-targeting drugs.
7. Age \> 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of bevacizumab in patients \<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.
8. Life expectancy of 8 weeks or greater.
9. ECOG performance status \< 2 (Karnofsky \> 60%).
10. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

    * Leukocytes \> 3,000/µl
    * Absolute neutrophil count \> 1,500/µl
    * Platelets \> 100,000/µl
    * Total Bilirubin \*\* Within institutional upper limit of normal
    * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \< 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
    * Creatinine\* Within institutional upper limit of normal\*

      * If creatinine \> upper limit of normal, a creatinine clearance \>/= 60 ml/m2 is required
      * Except for patients with known Gilbert's syndrome
11. The effects of bevacizumab on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because the anti-angiogenic agent used in this trial may be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
12. Concomitant use of steroids to treat cerebral edema is allowed.
13. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Disease-Specific Exclusions Patients with metastatic disease to the brain not fitting the inclusion criteria. Patients with leptomeningeal disease are not excluded.
* General Medical Exclusions

Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are ineligible for study entry:

1. Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.
2. Life expectancy of less than 8 weeks
3. Current, recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study), or planned participation in an experimental drug study other than this study.
4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to bevacizumab or temozolomide.
5. Patients must not exhibit any clinical evidence of coagulopathy. The INR must be \< 1.5 and the values for PTT must be within normal limits. Anticoagulation is not allowed.
6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, untreated cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because bevacizumab is an agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with bevacizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with bevacizumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
8. Otherwise well HIV-positive patients will be permitted to enroll on this trial.

Bevacizumab-Specific Exclusions

1. Previous treatment with bevacizumab.
2. Inadequately controlled hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure 150 and/or diastolic blood pressure \> 100 mmHg on antihypertensive medications)

- Sex: ALL
- Healthy Volunteers: No

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
Inclusion Criteria:

* Age ≥ 18 years at the time of informed consent
* Patient/legal authorized representative (LAR) must be able to provide informed consent.
* Patient must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of locally advanced unresectable stage III/IV or metastatic stage IV cutaneous or mucosal melanoma that has progressed on PD-1/PD-L1 therapy:

  o For Cohort A, the patient's melanoma must have progressed on prior PD-1 monotherapy
  * For Cohort B, the patient's melanoma must have progressed on prior combination PD-1 + LAG-3 blockade
  * Note: Intervening lines of targeted therapy, chemotherapy, bispecific (e.g. IMCgp100) and cell-based therapies are permitted between last ICI-based therapy and the start of study therapy
  * Note: For cohort A, peptide and mRNA vaccines may have been combined with PD-1 monotherapy as long as no other checkpoint inhibitors were concomitantly administered. For cohort B, peptide and mRNA vaccines may have been combined with combined PD-1 + LAG-3 blockade as long as no other checkpoint inhibitors were concomitantly administered Note: Prior PD-1 monotherapy (Cohort A) or PD-1 and LAG-3 blockade (Cohort B) may have been given in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting as long as progression is documented within 3 months of the final dose neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy
* Patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST v1.1 o Note: Lesions previously injected with Talimogene laherparepvec or other local therapies may not be selected as target lesions unless they have demonstrated subsequent growth after injection
* If a suitable archival tissue sample is available, the patient must be willing to have this specimen submitted for research. If an archival sample is not available, the patient is still a candidate for the trial, and every reasonable effort will be made to obtain a biopsy if deemed safe
* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

  ° Adequate laboratory function at screening, defined as:

  ° Hemoglobin ≥ 10 gm/dL (≥ 6.2 mmol/L)

  ° Platelet count ≥ 100 × 10\^9 /L

  °Serum direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN; AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN. (Total bilirubin \< 3 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's disease)
* No signs of active coronary ischemia, including ECG changes or elevated troponin if clinically indicated
* Calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥30 mL/min based on the Cockcroft-Gault equation
* All immune-related adverse events (irAE's) from prior ICI based therapy must have improved to Grade 1 or lower
* All women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)\* or sexually active men must practice highly effective contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment, during the study, and for at least 6 months after the last dose. Highly effective contraceptive measures in women include

  o Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening,
  * Intrauterine device (IUD),
  * Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS),
  * Bilateral tubal ligation,
  * Vasectomized partner,† and/or
  * Sexual abstinence.‡,§
* Male study participants with WOCBP partners are required to use condoms unless they are vasectomized† or practice sexual abstinence.‡,§
* \* WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the occurrence of a postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.

  * Vasectomized partner or vasectomized study participant must have received medical assessment of the surgical success.

    * Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

      * Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.

Exclusion Criteria

* Previously known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study.
* Received systemic treatment for cancer, including immunotherapy, within one month prior to initiation of dosing within this protocol. However, cell harvesting by leukapheresis may be performed before one month from prior therapy if the study investigators consider that it will not have a detrimental impact on the generation of the two cell therapies in this protocol.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Lentigo malignant (LM) is an intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation occurring on photoexposed skin. In our project, this term applies both to Dubreuilh's melanosis and to Dubreuilh's intraepidermal melanoma. It consequently excludes invasive melanoma. Although surgery is the treatment of choice, it remains without consensus on the margins (5 mm or 10 mm) excision for a localized tumor on the face.

Several studies have shown that imiquimod, activating local immunity by interferon production, i

### Trial: NCT00075166

**Title:** Surgery Versus Radiosurgery to Treat Metastatic Brain Tumors
**Official Title:** A Prospective, Randomized Trial Comparing Surgery Versus Radiosurgery for the Treatment of Metastatic Brain Tumors...
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Phase:** PHASE4

**STUDY DESIGN:**
- Type: INTERVENTIONAL
- Allocation: 
- Intervention Model: 
- Primary Purpose: TREATMENT
- Masking: 
- Enrollment: 130 ()

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
This study will compare the effectiveness of craniotomy to that of stereotactic surgery (SRS) for the treatment of metastatic brain tumors - tumors that first develop elsewhere in the body and then travel to the brain. Craniotomy is surgical removal of the tumors through an operation. SRS consists of highly focused radiation doses to the tumors. Neither treatment is experimental and both have shown benefits to patients with metastatic brain tumors. This study will determine whether one treatment

**INTERVENTIONS:**
- PROCEDURE: Stereotactic surgery (SRS)
- PROCEDURE: Craniotomy

**LOCATIONS:** (1 sites)
- United States: Maryland

**SPONSOR:** National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (NIH)

**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age:  to 
- Sex: ALL
- Healthy Volunteers: No

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients must:

1. be 21 years of age or older.
2. have a histologically confirmed primary malignancy.
3. be able to undergo an MRI scan of the brain.
4. have one to three intraparenchymal brain metastases as identified on a brain MRI scan with intravenous contrast.
5. have contrast enhancing tumor(s) that are well circumscribed and less than or equal to 4.0 cm in any dimension.
6. be appropriate for either procedure as determined by both a neurosurgeon and a radiation oncologist.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

Patients must not:

1. have tumor(s) in the midbrain, pons, or medulla - patients undergoing surgical resections in these areas are highly likely to develop significant neurological deficits or death.
2. have tumors within 10 millimeters of the optic apparatus (nerves and chiasm) or the area postrema - patients undergoing SRS to these areas are at significant risk of developing permanent blindness or intractable nausea.
3. be poor operative candidates from an anesthetic point of view secondary to other major medical illnesses - the risk of undergoing general anesthesia outweighs the potential benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain metastasis.
4. have a coagulopathy demonstrated by an abnormal prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, or thrombocytopenia (platelet count less that 150,000 platelets/mm3) - the risk of developing uncontrollable intra-operatively bleeding outweighs the potential benefit of undergoing surgical resection of a brain metastasis.
5. have radiographic or cerebrospinal fluid specimen evidence of widespread leptomeningeal metastasis - neither surgery nor SRS is a useful treatment modality for this condition.
6. significant psychiatric impairments which, in the opinion of the investigators, will interfere with the proper administration or completion of the protocol - self explanatory.
7. acute or untreated infections (viral, bacterial or fungal) - patients with active infections are highly likely to have spread of their infections to the brain as a result of a craniotomy.
8. be pregnant at the time of the randomized treatment - general anesthesia and surgery may subject the fetus to unacceptable risks. Also, the NIH does not offer full obstetrical services in the event that medical care to the mother and/or fetus is required. Pregnant women presenting with brain metastases will be referred to facilities offering OB/GYN services.
9. be prisoners or other institutionalized individuals - these individuals are at risk of being susceptible to undue influences to participate in a research protocol against their free will.
10. have a diagnosis of germ cell tumor, lymphoma or small cell lung cancer - these tumors are highly radiosensitive and should therefore be treated with radiation.
11. have any of the following: aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator, implanted cardiac pacemaker or auto defibrillator, cochlear implant, ocular foreign body or implant \[e.g. metal shavings, retinal clips\], or insulin pump as these items would be contra-indications to undergoing an MRI scan.
12. have an allergy to iodine or shellfish or have previously had an allergic reaction to iodinated-contrast agents as this is a contra-indication to undergoing a contrast enhanced CT of the brain - a contrast enhanced CT of the brain is required for the planning of SRS.
