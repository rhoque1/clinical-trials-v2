**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
The WINGMEN trial aims to understand how a hormone-like protein called insulin-like growth factor (IGF) helps prostate cancers grow and become aggressive. IGF is required for normal development, and also helps cancers grow and spread. Men with high blood IGF are at increased risk of developing prostate cancer, and tall men are more likely to get aggressive prostate cancer. The WINGMEN trial will recruit 30 men with prostate cancer who have been offered an operation to remove the prostate. Most m

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Prostate cancer is currently the second most common cause of cancer death in men in Western countries. Lymphadenectomy is the gold standard procedure for staging pelvic lymph node and is classically indicated in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer patients and is held at the same time of prostatectomy. A traditionally pelvic lymphadenectomy covers the obturator chain bilaterally. Recently, some studies have demonstrated the existence of lymph node involvement outside the traditional bound

Genetic testing is a type of test that detects changes to the genes-the DNA instructions that are passed on from the mother and father. The results of a genetic test can confirm whether the participant has a genetic disorder, which is a disease caused in whole or in part by changes to the genes. Genetic testing can also help determine a person's chance of getting or passing on a genetic disorder. Genetic tests use a sample of blood, hair, skin, or other tissue, and they can look at one gene or m

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Background:

Fat and calcium can build up as plaque in artery walls. The Agatston score measures plaque using computed tomography (CT) that does not use an injected contrast agent. Plaque in the arteries of the pelvis and abdomen is linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. It also may affect cancer. But abdominal CTs use a contrast agent (CECT). Therefore, the Agatston score cannot be used. Researchers want to find a way to measure plaque in CECTs. This will help them use abdominal C

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Systemic therapy (i.e Androgen Deprivation Therapy with Docetaxel, Enzalutamide, Apalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate) has increased overall survival in men with hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer.

Novel local cytoreductive treatments and metastasis directed therapy are being evaluated, these can confer additional harm, but might improve survival.

We aim to elicit men's preferences for and willingness to accept trade-offs between potential improved survival and cytoreductive treatment

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus R115777 in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining trastuzumab with R115777 may kill more tumor cells.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well abiraterone acetate, niclosamide, and prednisone work in treating patients with hormone-resistant prostate cancer. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cells. Hormone therapy using abiraterone acetate may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgen the body makes. Niclosamide is a drug that may block another signal that can cause prostate cancer cell growth. Prednisone is a drug that can help lessen inflammation. Giving
