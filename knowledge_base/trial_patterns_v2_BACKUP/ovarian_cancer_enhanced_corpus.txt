**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age: 18 Years to 30 Years
- Sex: FEMALE
- Healthy Volunteers: Yes

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
Inclusion Criteria:

* PCOS group: post-pubertal (\> 4 years post-menarche) adult woman aged 18-30 years with PCOS, defined as clinical and/or laboratory evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism and/or elevated serum \[calculated\] free testosterone concentration) plus ovulatory dysfunction (irregular menses, fewer than 9 per year), but without evidence for other potential causes of hyperandrogenism and/or ovulatory dysfunction
* Control group: post-pubertal (\> 4 years post-menarche) adult woman aged 18-30 years with regular menstrual periods (every 26-35 days) and no evidence of hyperandrogenism (i.e., no hirsutism, normal serum \[calculated\] free testosterone concentration)
* General good health (excepting overweight, obesity, PCOS, and adequately-treated hypothyroidism)
* Capable of and willing to provide informed consent
* Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of reliable non-hormonal methods during the study period

Exclusion Criteria:

* Inability/incapacity to provide informed consent
* Males will be excluded (hyperandrogenism is unique to females)
* Age \< 18 years (we do not propose to study children because we have no preliminary data that would support this particular study in children)
* Age \> 30 years (since ovarian reserve may decrease beyond age 30)
* Obesity resulting from a well-defined endocrinopathy or genetic syndrome
* Positive pregnancy test or current lactation
* Evidence for non-physiologic or non-PCOS causes of hyperandrogenism and/or anovulation
* Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice, clitoromegaly)
* Total testosterone \> 150 ng/dl, which suggests the possibility of virilizing ovarian or adrenal tumor
* DHEA-S greater than upper reference range limit for controls; and DHEA-S elevation \> 1.5 times the upper reference range limit for PCOS. Mild elevations may be seen in PCOS, and will be accepted in this group.
* Early morning 17-hydroxyprogesterone \> 200 ng/dl measured in the follicular phase, which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if elevated during the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be repeated during the follicular phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone \> 200 ng/dl is confirmed on repeat testing, an ACTH stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone \< 1000 ng/dl will be required for study participation.
* Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH): Note that subjects with stable and adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be excluded.
* Hyperprolactinemia: Any degree of hyperprolactinemia (confirmed on repeat) will be grounds for exclusion for subjects without PCOS. Hyperprolactinemia \> 20% higher than the upper limit of normal will be grounds for exclusion for subjects without PCOS. Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in PCOS, and elevations within 20% higher than the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.
* History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of Cushing's syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, or acromegaly
* History and/or physical exam findings suggestive of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (e.g., symptoms of estrogen deficiency) including functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (which may be suggested by a constellation of symptoms including restrictive eating patterns, excessive exercise, psychological stress, etc.)
* Persistent hematocrit \< 36% and hemoglobin \< 12 g/dl
* Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets \< 50,000 cells/microliter) or leukopenia (total white blood count \< 4,000 cells/microliter)
* Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose \> or = 126 mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c \> or = 6.5%
* Persistent liver panel abnormalities, with two exceptions. Mild bilirubin elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Also, mild transaminase elevations may be seen in obesity/PCOS; therefore, elevations \< 1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in these groups.
* Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected congestive heart failure, asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroids, etc.)
* Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR \< 60 ml/min/1.73m2
* A personal history of breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer
* History of any other cancer diagnosis and/or treatment (with the exception of basal cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma) unless they have remained clinically disease free (based on appropriate surveillance) for five years
* History of allergy to transdermal estradiol patches
* BMI \< 18 or \> 40 kg/m2; BMI \< 18 kg/m2 is considered to be underweight, while \> 40 kg/m2 is considered to be class 3 obesity -- both may have marked confounding effects for the outcomes of interest
* Menstrual cycles lasting fewer than 26 days: Cycle frequency \< 26 days suggest the possibility of relatively short follicular phases (e.g., \< 12 days). If a subject with a follicular phase shorter than 12 days participates in Aim 1c, they could experience an endogenous gonadotropin surge under surveillance. Since we wish to capture only experimentally-induced surges, we will exclude such subjects.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder that affects approximately 10-15% of women of reproductive age. Increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis is considered to be one of the main factors associated with the pathogenesis of PCOS. The regulation of the activity of this axis is influenced by the following factors: insulin resistance and the activity of kisspeptins in the hypothalamus. It is suggested that intestinal dysbiosis may also play a key role in the patho

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Ovarian cancer is deadly and generally diagnosed at late stage when the chances of survival are low. There is a current belief that this cancer starts in the fallopian tubes and progresses towards the ovaries, spreading to the cells on the surface. Within the fallopian tubes and the uterus, there is a constant flow of mucus which has only one exit through the cervix and out the vagina. Proteins that are generated within the entire female reproductive system are trapped into this viscous fluid an

A major obstacle to the development of these vaccines is that there are specialty cells called regulatory T cells that prevent the immune system from attacking all of our organs. These regulatory T cells also prevent our immune system for attacking cancer cells.

  * Patients must have absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL
  * Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcL
  * PT (INR) \< 1.5
  * PTT \< 1.5x control
  * Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) \*\*Cohort 4 patients should undergo laboratory testing within 7 days prior to the microdevice placement
* Participants must be evaluated by a surgical gynecologic oncologist who will determine the clinically appropriate treatment strategy (primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy) based on clinical history and extent of disease. The patient's surgical and/or medical gynecologic oncologist must also confirm the patient's medical fitness to undergo an additional biopsy procedure and the indicated surgical procedure. The patient must have a plan to undergo surgery for clinical purposes.
* The following criteria must be met:

  * Participants must have undergone an abdominal/pelvic CT scan that both assesses the extent of disease and identifies an area of tumor amenable to safe microdevice placement. CT scans with both oral and IV contrast media are preferred but not required.

CT scans performed at outside institutions are acceptable providing that the images are considered adequate to assess the stage of the disease and to assess the safety and feasibility of the placement of the microdevices and their retrieval during standard-of care surgery. CT scan must be completed within 4 weeks prior to the microdevice placement.

* Patient has sufficient volume of disease as measured by CT scan to allow implantation of the microdevice.
* Patient has sufficient volume of disease that removal of the lesion where the microdevice is placed will not potentially affect adequate tissue for diagnosis.
* A lesion can be selected where the microdevice is to be implanted that is

  * Amenable to percutaneous placement
  * Amenable to removal at the time of surgery or laparoscopy. If patient is undergoing laparoscopy, the lesion must be able to be removed using a laparoscopic approach in a manner that would not significantly alter the procedure or affect patient safety, per opinion of the surgical oncologist.

    * Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.
    * Patients must be willing to undergo research-related genetic sequencing (somatic and germline) and data management, including the deposition of de-identified genetic sequencing data in NIH central data repositories.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit the safety of a biopsy and/or surgery.
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the possible increased dose of radiation from imaging associated with the microdevice placement and the potential risk to the pregnancy of the biopsy/device placement in an abdominal lesion.
* Uncorrectable bleeding or coagulation disorder known to cause increased risk with surgical or percutaneous biopsy procedures.
* Significant risk factors (including, but not limited to, high risk of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke or myocardial infarction) precluding the safe cessation of anticoagulation medication as per SIR guidelines. (Patients taking low-dose aspirin only do not need to be excluded.)

**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** EGFR, HER2, ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age: 18 Years to 100 Years
- Sex: ALL
- Healthy Volunteers: No

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

(All Subjects)

1. Patients must have a metastatic or unresectable locally advanced malignant solid tumor, histologically confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute (NCI). In the case of chordoma, unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic tumors are acceptable for enrollment, given that this represents incurable disease. Efforts will be made, as much as possible, to enroll patients with tumor types with known increased expression of brachyury (such as lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic, or chordoma; other tumors may be included as data on the level of brachyury in those tumors becomes available).
2. Patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease. Patients with surgically resected metastatic disease at high risk of relapse are also eligible.
3. Prior therapy: Patients must have completed or had disease progression on at least one prior line of disease-appropriate therapy for metastatic disease, or not be candidates for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease.
4. There should be a minimum of 4 weeks from any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or radiation, with the exception of hormonal therapy for prostate and breast cancers, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed therapy for HER2+ breast cancer (3+ immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH+), and erlotinib in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated lung cancer in the expansion cohort as detailed in section. There should be a minimum of 6 weeks from any prior antibody therapies, (such as ipilimumab or anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) due to prolonged half-life.
5. Patients must have recovered (grade 1 or baseline) from any clinically significant toxicity associated with prior therapy. Typically, this is 3-4 weeks for patients who most recently received cytotoxic therapy, except for the nitrosoureas and mitomycin C, for which 6 weeks is needed for recovery.
6. Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-brachyury-B7-1, ICAM-1 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1), and LFA-3 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3) TRICOM vaccine in patients \< 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.
7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 1 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 70%).
8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

   * Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR creatinine clearance on a 24-h urine collection of greater than or equal to 50 mL/min.
   * Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x the upper limits of normal.
   * Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal OR in patients with Gilbert's syndrome, a total bilirubin less than or equal to 3.0.
   * Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

     * Granulocyte count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm\^3
     * Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm\^3
9. Patients must have baseline pulse oximetry \> 90% on room air.
10. The effects of MVA-brachyury-TRICOM on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and for a period of 4 months after the last vaccination therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
11. Patients with prostate cancer must continue to receive gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy (unless orchiectomy has been done). If a patient has refused GnRH therapy, they may be enrolled on a dose level for which the safety has already been determined.

Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent document.

INCLUSION CRITERIA:

(Expansion Phase Only)

The following inclusion criteria apply specifically to patients being considered for the expansion phase of the protocol.

1. Subjects with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated lung cancer may continue erlotinib if they have been on the drug for greater than or equal to 3 months with stable disease or a response. Erlotinib may also be continued in the case of a progressing tumor after prior response (or \> 6 months stable disease).
2. Patients with Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer being treated with hormonal therapy (selective estrogen receptor modulator or aromatase inhibitor) who have rising tumor markers as evidence of disease progression or metastatic disease on scans may continue on hormonal therapy while being treated with vaccine.
3. Patients with Her2+ breast cancer receiving Her2-directed therapy (e.g. trastuzumab) may continue on that therapy when enrolling into a dose level for which safety has been established.
4. Subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer may continue "maintenance" therapy with capecitabine and/or bevacizumab.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

1. Concurrent treatment for cancer, with specific exceptions noted in inclusion criteria.
2. Chronic hepatitis B or C infection, because potential immune impairment caused by these disorders may diminish the effectiveness of this immunologic therapy.
3. Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the patient's tolerance of study treatment.
4. Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.
5. Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a history of autoimmune disease that might be stimulated by vaccine treatment. This requirement is due to the potential risks of exacerbating autoimmunity. However, patients with vitiligo or clinically stable autoimmune endocrine disease who are on appropriate replacement therapy (if such therapy is indicated) are eligible.
6. Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use. Limited pharmacologic doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease or to prevent intravenous (I.V.) contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed.
7. Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 28 days before start of study treatment.
8. Patients with untreated central nervous system metastases or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6 months. Patients with stable brain metastasis for 6 months post-intervention are eligible. Subjects with chordoma will be eligible regardless of site of disease if other eligibility criteria are met.
9. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to MVA-brachyury-TRICOM or other agents used in study.
10. Serious or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.
11. Pregnant women are excluded from this study due to the unknown effects of the MVAbrachyury-TRICOM vaccine on the fetus or infant. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MVA-brachyury-TRICOM, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with MVA-brachyury-TRICOM. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
12. Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV)-positive patients are ineligible because of the potential for decreased immune response to the vaccine.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Background:

Many cancer cells produce substances called antigens that are unique to each cancer. These antigens stimulate the body s immune responses. One approach to treating these cancers is to take disease-fighting white blood cells from a person, change those cells so they will target the specific proteins (called antigens) from the cancer cells, and return them to that person s blood. The use of the white blood cells in this manner is one form of gene therapy. A vaccine may help these modi

  * Patients who did not receive chemotherapy should be randomized within 12 weeks after definitive surgery; such patients should have estradiol (E2) in the premenopausal range following surgery; the only patients who do not require testing of estradiol (E2) to confirm premenopausal status are those who have been menstruating regularly during the 6 months prior to randomization and have not used any form of hormonal contraception or any other hormonal treatments during the 6 months prior to randomization
  * Patients who received prior adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be randomized after completing chemotherapy and within 8 months of the final dose of chemotherapy as soon as premenopausal status is confirmed; all such patients should have premenopausal status confirmed by an estradiol (E2) in the premenopausal range between 2 weeks and 8 months after completing chemotherapy
  * Adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin ®) is allowable, and is not considered to be chemotherapy for eligibility timing determination

  * A total mastectomy; radiotherapy is optional after mastectomy OR
  * A breast-conserving procedure (lumpectomy, quadrantectomy or partial mastectomy with margins clear of invasive cancer and ductal breast carcinoma in situ \[DCIS\]); the local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology report; if all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed; likewise, if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed; radiation therapy to the conserved breast is required; patients may be randomized before, during or after completion of radiation therapy to the breast
* Either axillary lymph node dissection (pathological examination of at least 6 nodes recommended) or a negative axillary sentinel node biopsy (pN0\[sn\]) is required; patients with negative or microscopically axillary positive sentinel nodes (pN1mi: micrometastasis none \> 2.0 mm) do not require further axillary therapy; those with positive sentinel nodes must have either an axillary dissection or radiation of axillary nodes
* For International Breast Cancer Study Groups (IBCSG) centers, patients must have completed baseline Quality of Life (QL) Forms prior to randomization; the only exceptions are cognitive or physical impairment that interferes with QL assessment or inability to read any of the languages available on IBCSG QL forms; for non-IBCSG centers, extent of participation in the QL study is to be determined at the activation of the trial for each cooperative group

    * Stage Ia carcinoma of the cervix
    * Stage Ia or b endometrioid endometrial cancer
    * Borderline or stage I ovarian cancer
* Patients with other non-malignant systemic diseases (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, lung, etc.) that would prevent prolonged follow-up; patients with previous thrombosis (e.g., deep vein thrombosis \[DVT\]) and/or embolism can be included only if medically suitable
* Patients who have had a bilateral oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation; patients who will be recommended to undergo oophorectomy within 5 years (e.g., breast cancer susceptibility gene \[BRCA\]1/2 gene carriers) and therefore for whom randomization to a treatment arm without OFS is inappropriate
* Patients with a history of noncompliance to medical regimens and patients who are considered potentially unreliable
* Patients who are pregnant or lactating at the time of randomization or who desire a pregnancy within 5 years; patients planning to use additional hormonal therapy apart from the randomized treatment during the next five years including all types of hormonal contraception; a pregnancy test is recommended for women of child-bearing potential who are sexually active and not using reliable contraceptive methods
* Patients who received endocrine therapy (including neoadjuvant and adjuvant) for more than 8 months after their breast cancer diagnosis; patients who are receiving endocrine therapy at randomization (and have received it for less than 8 months) may continue such therapy until protocol-specified tamoxifen/exemestane is initiated
