**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

The participants will be affected by an IBMFS, or be members of a family with an IBMFS, and be at risk of being affected or carriers of the syndrome. Except for the rare X-linked recessive disorder (e.g. some dyskeratosis congenita patients), there should be equal numbers of male and female probands and family members. These IBMFS have been reported in most racial and ethnic groups, and thus all such groups will be included. The age range will be from birth to old age (grandparents of probands). The majority of the probands will be children (10-20% will be adults), and their parents and grandparents will be adults. All racial/ethnic groups are eligible.

INCLUSION CRITERIA for Patients:

* Fanconi s anemia.
* Diamond Blackfan anemia.
* Dyskeratosis congenita.
* Shwachman Diamond Syndrome.
* Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia.
* Thrombocytopenia absent radii.
* Severe Congenital Neutropenia.
* Pearson Syndrome.
* Other bone marrow failure syndromes.

Family Members of IBMFS - Affected Subjects:

-Family members include first degree relatives of IBMFS-affected subjects as defined here, i.e. siblings (half or full), biologic parents, and children. Grandparents of IBMFS-affected subjects are also included, specifically for Hypothesis 4. The age range will be from birth to old age (grandparents of probands).

Patients in the general population:

-Patients in the general population with sporadic tumors of the types seen in the IBMFS (head and neck, gastrointestinal, and anogenital cancer), with none of the usual risk factors for those tumors (e.g. smoking, drinking, HPV). These patients will be further evaluated for an IBMFS by the referring physician under the guidance of the study investigators and if diagnosed with an IBMFS or if not diagnosed but highly suspicious for an IBMFS, would be eligible for inclusion in the Field and Clinic Center cohorts.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

-Affected: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:

* Evidence that the hematologic disorder is acquired rather than genetic. Such evidence includes temporal relation of the aplastic anemia to known marrow suppressant drugs, chemicals, toxins, or viruses (in the absence of evidence indicative of an inherited marrow failure disorder).
* Known causes of cytopenias such as autoantibodies to red cells, platelets, or neutrophils, viruses (especially hepatitis), micronutrient deficiencies, transient erythroblastopenia of childhood, and cyclic neutropenia.
* Assignment of the patient s physical findings to other syndromes or causes that are not part of the IBMFS disease spectrum.
* Inability of the participant or LAR to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent document.
* Unwillingness to permit access to medical records and pathology specimens.

There are no other exclusion parameters not related to the primary disease.

-Unaffected/Family Members: An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:

* Patients on a cholesterol lowering statin must be on a stable dose with no dose changes within 3 weeks prior to study start
* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial as long as their anti-retroviral therapy does not have the potential for drug-drug interactions as judged by the treating investigator
* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated
* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load
* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if follow-up brain imaging after at least 4 weeks following central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy shows no evidence of progression
* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial
* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better
* Patients must have lesions amenable to research biopsy for those enrolling to the expansion cohort. The biopsy should be deemed feasible and safe for pre-biopsy lesion assessment criteria
* The effects of CA-4948, nab-paclitaxel, and gemcitabine on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because gemcitabine is known to be teratogenic, embryotoxic, and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 6 months after completion of CA-4948, nab-paclitaxel, and gemcitabine administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of CA-4948, nab-paclitaxel, and gemcitabine administration
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study
* Patients who have not recovered from clinically significant adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \> grade 1) with the exception of alopecia
* History of other malignancy with the exception of 1) malignancies for which all treatment was completed at least 2 years before registration and the patient has no evidence of disease; 2) or known indolent malignancies that do not require treatment and will likely not alter the course of treatment of disease under treatment

* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents
* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CA-4948 or other agents used in study
* Patients receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible due to CA-4948 and nab-paclitaxel. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine is nucleoside analogue with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with gemcitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with gemcitabine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study
* Prolonged Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF) (\> 470 in females, \> 450 in males) on screening electrocardiogram (ECG)
* Gastrointestinal condition which could impair absorption of CA-4948 or inability to ingest CA-4948

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus R115777 in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer. Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining trastuzumab with R115777 may kill more tumor cells.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibili

1. Erlotinib (EXPERIMENTAL)
   Eligible patients will receive erlotinib 150mg PO daily, with dose escalation occurring as tolerated.

**INTERVENTIONS:**
- DRUG: Erlotinib

**PRIMARY OUTCOMES:**
- Measure: Objective Response Rate
  Timeframe: Clinically assessed every cycle (month) and radiologically assessed every 2 cycles (2 months) with CT scan
  Description: Measured by the rate of disease control (objective response plus prolonged stable disease), in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

**SECONDARY OUTCOMES:** (2 total)
- Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability of Erlotinib]
- Tolerability of Erlotinib Dose Escalation

**LOCATIONS:** (5 sites)
- International: Canada

**SPONSOR:** University Health Network, Toronto (OTHER)
**COLLABORATORS:** OSI Pharmaceuticals

**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** EGFR, KRAS, ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age: 18 Years to 
- Sex: ALL
- Healthy Volunteers: No

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma that is locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic.
* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \>20 mm with conventional techniques or as \>10 mm with spiral CT scan.
* Previous therapy:

Surgery: Previous surgery is permissible. Patients must be \> 4 weeks from any major surgery.

* Chemotherapy: Patients may have received up to 1 prior line of gemcitabine based systemic therapy (single agent or combination therapy) for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Prior therapy with inhibitors of angiogenesis is permitted. All toxicities must be resolved to \< Grade 1 (CTCAE v 3.0) and the last dose must have been given at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.
* Patients may also have received prior 5 FU (+/- folinic acid) or gemcitabine given concurrently with radiation as a "radiation sensitizer". All toxicities must be resolved and the last dose of chemotherapy must have been given at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.
* Radiation: Patients may have received prior radiation treatment for management of local disease providing that disease progression has been documented (either locally or systemically), all toxicities have resolved, and the last fraction of radiation treatment was completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization.
* Age \>18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of erlotinib in patients \<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric single-agent trials, if applicable.
* Life expectancy of greater than or equal to 3 months.

ECOG performance status \<2.

* Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

  * Leukocytes \>/= 3,000/mcL
  * Absolute neutrophil count \>/= 1,000/mcL
  * Platelets \>/= 100,000/mcL
  * Total bilirubin \</= 1.5 UNL
  * AST(SGOT) \</= 2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal
  * INR \</= 1.5 unless on warfarin (see 3.1.9)
  * Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR
  * Creatinine clearance \>/= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal
* Since CYP3A4 appears to be the major enzyme responsible for the human hepatic metabolism of erlotinib in vitro, the concurrent use of inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 are prohibited during the study treatment period. Concurrent use of CYP3A4 substrates are allowed, however, use caution and monitor the patient for potential drug interactions.
* There is a potential interaction between erlotinib and warfarin. Patients have experienced elevated INRs and bleeding with this combination of drugs. Patients on warfarin with PT INR \>1.5 are eligible provided that all of the following criteria are met:
* The patient is therapeutic on a stable dose of warfarin
* The upper target for INR is no greater than 3.
* The patient has no active bleeding or pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding (e.g., CT evidence of tumor invading the duodenum or known varices).

Note: anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin is permitted.

* The effects of erlotinib on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
* Patients receiving any other investigational agents concurrently are ineligible.
* Prior therapy with inhibitors of the EGFR (eg. cetuximab, EMD 72000, panitumumab, gefitinib, erlotinib) or multitargeted agents that inhibit EGFR (eg. ZD6474, AEE788).
* Patients with allergies to or a history of allergic reactions attributed to any other compound of similar chemical or biologic composition to erlotinib.
* Patients with greater than grade 1 diarrhea at baseline. Patients with pancreatic cancer often have diarrhea due to pancreatic insufficiency, so a trial of pancreatic enzymes may be warranted to reduce baseline diarrhea.
* PT INR \>1.5 unless the patient is on full-dose warfarin.
* Patients with any condition that impairs their ability to swallow and retain pills
* Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because erlotinib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with erlotinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with erlotinib.
* HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with erlotinib. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
