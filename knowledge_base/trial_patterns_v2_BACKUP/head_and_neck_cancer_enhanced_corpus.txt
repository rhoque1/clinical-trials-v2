* To be eligible, individuals must speak Russian or Kazakh, be able to participate in a two-hour focus group session, and have a verified history of residing in the village during the 1950s. Verification of residence history will be based on regional records.

  1. Women: In each village, we will recruit 24 women. We will select women who are age 70 years and older and who had children or provided care to children (i.e., younger siblings, nieces and nephews) during the 1950s. Our first priority is to recruit women whose own children were less than 21 years during the 1950s. If necessary, we will also recruit women who provided care to children other than their own (e.g., younger siblings, nieces and nephews) during this period. We will recruit both members of our 1998 cohort members and other women in the community who meet the eligibility criteria. Subjects will be chosen to represent experience caring for children of different ages at the time of the nuclear tests. In order to recruit women who had children of different ages (less than 21 years) during the 1950s, we will screen potential participants for their children s years of birth and attempt to enroll women whose children represent a range of ages during the 1950 s.
  2. Men: In each village, we will recruit eight men (Russian and Kazakh) age 70 and older who were engaged in farming and care of dairy animals at the time of the nuclear tests.

Investigators have recently shown that epigenetic remodelling enzymes, such as HDAC inhibitors, are feasible drugs in HNC (8, 9). Preliminary data are indicating some deregulated epigenetics marks suggesting the corresponding histone modifiers as possible targets for the treatment of HNC, providing an attractive and feasible option to build upon. Our overarching hypothesis is that unique histone marks distinguish HPV+ and HPV- HNC and that specific histone modifiers are novel mediators of HNC tu

* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\< 2 (Karnofsky \>= 60%)
* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months
* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as \>= 20 mm (\>= 2 cm) with conventional techniques or as \>= 10 mm (\>= 1 cm) with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or calipers by clinical exam

* Definitive clinical or radiographic evidence of distant metastasis or adenopathy below the clavicles
* M6620 (VX-970, berzosertib) is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4; therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 should be avoided; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of; as part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product

* Patients taking cyclooxygenase (COX)-1/COX-2 inhibitors (Indomethacin, Ibuprofen, celebrex) chronically, herbal supplements, who cannot be taken off the medication/supplement due to their clinical condition are eligible to participate in the study but should document daily doses of these medications in their logbooks

Exclusion Criteria:

* History of intolerance (including hypersensitivity or allergy) to berry or berry-containing products
* Inability to take oral nutrition/liquids or history of aspiration pneumonia
* Pregnant women: Although there are no known adverse effects of black raspberries upon the fetus, if patients become pregnant during period of lyophilized black raspberries (LBR) administration, then LBR will be discontinued and patient will be removed from the study; we should however emphasize, given this is a food based-study, that risks are likely extremely low even though a participant should become pregnant; as such, we are not recommending active contraception for women, but rather if participants become pregnant, that they notify their study doctor, and that they will likely be removed from study; there are no expected or logical risks if men were to father a child, and as such, no contraception will be recommended for men
* Inability to grant informed consent
* Strict Vegetarians will be excluded from the study; it was found that consuming one portion per day of fruit or vegetables resulted in a significant decrease in oral cancer incidence; in those persons consuming multiple portions each day, there was a 50% reduction in risk; we assume that strict vegetarians will consume multiple portions each day of foods with chemopreventive activity and therefore inclusion of these individuals would have a negative impact on the study; there are several reports in the literature that herbal or multivitamin/mineral supplements have no effect on oral cancer incidence

**SPONSOR:** University of Chicago (OTHER)

**BIOMARKERS MENTIONED:** PD-L1, ATM

**ELIGIBILITY:**
- Age: 18 Years to 
- Sex: ALL
- Healthy Volunteers: No

**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
Inclusion Criteria:

* Patients must have histologically confirmed head and neck cancer (Squamous cell histology as well as HPV+ and/or EBV+ head and neck tumors), Stages IVA, IVB, and select cases of Stage III.

  * HPV status required prior to randomization for oropharyngeal primary tumors
  * EBV status is required prior to randomization for nasopharyngeal primary tumors
* Completed curative intent therapy, without additional standard of care curative intent therapy feasible within 20 weeks prior to study enrollment
* After prior curative intent treatment for HNC have estimated risk of recurrence ≥ 40-50% and fall into one of the below categories (A, OR B, OR C, OR D, OR E). While exact estimation of the risk of recurrence can be difficult the following categories will be included reflecting patients at substantial risk for tumor recurrence or already with early evidence of recurrence:

  * A: Any of the below HNC patients are eligible for adjuvant treatment on this protocol AFTER completion of curative intent therapy:
* HPV(-) HNC: N2C, N3, bulky N2B disease (≥ 5cm LN/tumor conglomerate).
* HPV(+) HNC: N2C, N3, AND ≥ 10 pack years of tobacco use
* HPV(+) HNC with multilevel nodal involvement, AND bulky N2B disease (≥ 5cm LN/tumor conglomerate), AND ≥ 10 pack years of tobacco use
* EBV(+) NPC may be eligible if other criteria under A, or alternative criteria B, or C, or D, or E are met.
* HNC with supraclavicular or mediastinal nodal involvement (any HPV or EPV status ) at time of curative intent treatment and were treated as part of curative intent therapy
* Residual mass in area of prior tumor that on biopsy does not show residual tumor, is equivocal/not highly-suspicious on imaging but remains of concern, requires close follow-up AND is not resected/amenable to resection OR immediate palliative treatment.
* Non-responders to induction chemotherapy (PD on induction, or lack of tumor shrinkage (\< 15% per RECIST)
* Interrupted treatment course or lower than intended radiation dose - i.e. interruption of radiation by ≥ 3 weeks (cumulative), or delivery of ≤ 50 Gy as part of a radiation based treatment (that was NOT a de-escalation approach).

  * B: Patient treated with salvage treatment (i.e. salvage surgery or re-irradiation) for residual or recurrent tumor after prior radiation based therapy (either HPV+ or HPV- or EBV+) AND not a candidate for additional curative intent therapy (for various reasons including poor performance status, comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc). Positive margins or residual tumor may still be acceptable (see D)). Patients should also not be appropriate for systemic palliative therapy (e.g. in the case of overt disease).
  * C: Metastases or indeterminate distant lesions that are not appropriate for either local radiation/SBRT treatment and also not appropriate for initiation of palliative system therapy (e.g. in the setting of overt metastatic disease). Such lesions should be negative/equivocal by PET imaging and if amenable negative by biopsy, but remain of concern and require close follow-up
  * D: Oligometastatic disease treated with SBRT or other curative-intent therapy (e.g. surgery or RFA, etc) for oligometastatic disease.
  * E: Microscopic or very low volume residual tumor after surgery or radiation based treatment (including salvage treatment or SBRT for oligometastatic disease), AND not a candidate for either additional curative intent therapy (for various reasons including feasibility, poor performance status, comorbidities, refusal of patient, prior radiation or re-irradiation, etc) AND also not a candidate for systemic palliative therapy (for various reasons including microscopic/non-(RECIST) measurable low volume disease). Very low volume disease is defined as non-RECIST measurable).
  * F: Patients with multiple recurrences or multiple primaries: specifically patients who had malignant or pre-malignant tumors/changes (with severe dysplasia present), who have undergone surgery ≥ 2 times, and currently do not have an indication for additional (adjuvant) treatment such as radiation, or surgery, or other treatment. This may include multiple recurrences/incidences of early stage tumors or premalignant lesions, however at least one lesion needs to show squamous cell carcinoma on pathology.

NOTE: There may be additional scenarios for patients that are considered very high risk for disease recurrence and not appropriate for either curative or standard of care palliative therapy. Such patients can be considered for enrollment after discussion and approval by the PI and/or co-PI.

* Availability of tumor tissue (≥ 10 slides) for PD-L1, gene expression profiling (GEP), and additional testing.
* Be willing and able to provide written informed consent/assent for the trial.
* Be 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.
* Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. An ECOG performance status of 2 is acceptable if the patient was ECOG 0/1 prior to curative intent therapy and is in the midst of recovery from curative intent therapy
* Demonstrate reasonable organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment initiation.

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cisplatin may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them
