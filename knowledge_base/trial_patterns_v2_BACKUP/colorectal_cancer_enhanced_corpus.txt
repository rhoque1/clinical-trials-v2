**ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:**
Inclusion Criteria:

* Underwent screening or surveillance colonoscopy at MGH within the last 9 months with removal of at least one adenoma.
* Age 18-80 years.
* This study will only include adult participants because colorectal carcinogenesis in children is more likely to be related to a cancer predisposition syndrome with distinct biological mechanisms compared with sporadic colorectal cancer in adults. Patients over age 80 will not be enrolled since the benefits and risks of a daily aspirin regimen over the age of 80 have not yet been well-characterized.
* ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)
* Not currently taking aspirin (any dose) within the last 6 months.
* The effects of aspirin on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.
* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Use of any non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) at any dose at least three times a week during the two months prior to randomization.
* Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, liver or kidney disease, bleeding diathesis
* Any prior diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer (including esophageal, small intestine, colon, pancreatic), or any diagnosis of other cancers (with the exception of non- melanoma skin) in which there has been any active treatment within the last three years
* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.
* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to aspirin.
* Known diagnosis of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) or Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC, Lynch Syndrome).
* Any adenoma that was not completely removed during previous colonoscopy.
* History of aspirin intolerance, bleeding diathesis, peptic ulcer or gastrointestinal bleed, endoscopic complications, or contraindication to colonoscopy.
* Inability or unwillingness to abstain from non-protocol use of aspirin or NSAIDs or to provide blood, urine, or stool samples or colon biopsies during the study.
* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
* Pregnant or breastfeeding.
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because aspirin is an FDA Category D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with aspirin, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with aspirin.
* Participant must be able to swallow pills.
* Participant is taking any anticoagulant agent (e.g. warfarin) or antiplatelet agent (e.g. clopidogrel).

Treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer needs chemotherapy in most of the cases. During these last years, many new chemotherapies and targeted therapies have been developed improving significantly the overall survival of patients. However, the choice of the therapeutic sequences becomes difficult due to the lack of validated predictive biomarkers of their efficiency. Indeed, only the mutation of the k-ras oncogene is a predictive factor of non-efficacy of the anti-EGFR antibodies. It is thus c

* Eligible for one of the RQRS breast or colon Quality of Care Indicators
* Age of 21 or older
* Not known to be deceased at the time of contact

The NCCCP is a network of 30 community hospitals in 22 states supporting cancer research and enhancing cancer care for patients close to home. Most cancer patients in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated at community hospitals; not in NCI Comprehensive Cancer Centers where much research is conducted. The National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) is expanding cancer research and bringing advanced cancer treatments to patients in community hospitals in rural, suburban and inner-city areas.

This study is being conducted at the 16 pilot NCCCP sites that first entered the program in 2007. All 16 participate in RQRS. These 16 pilot sites are located in 14 states throughout the United States.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

* Patients will be excluded for the following reasons:Patient is ineligible for one of the 5 RQRS breast or colon quality indicators
* Patient is deceased at the time of sampling
* Patient has Stage IV cancer

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Natural killer (NK) cells are leukocytes of the innate immune system and play a central role in the control of cancer metastases. NK cells and other innate immune cells often do not function well in patients with cancer and are also profoundly suppressed after cancer surgery. Dr. Auer's Lab and others have shown that NK cells are critically important in the clearance of tumor metastases and that their impairment can be recovered with immune therapy augmenting the innate immune system.

**Title:** Atezolizumab With Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Tumours
**Official Title:** A Phase II Study to Assess the Efficacy of the Anti-PD-L1 Antibody Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) Administered With Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in Patients With Metastatic Tumours...
**Status:** ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING

- Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP
- Primary Purpose: TREATMENT
- Masking: NONE
- Enrollment: 138 (ACTUAL)

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Although it is usually described as an immunosuppressive modality and not thought of as immunotherapy, there are new preclinical evidences suggesting that high-dose ionizing irradiation (IR) results in direct tumour cell death and augments tumour-specific immunity, which enhances tumour control both locally and distantly. Importantly, IR effects exceed the classical cytocidal properties by also causing phenotypic changes in the fraction of surviving cells, markedly enhancing their susceptibility

**BRIEF SUMMARY:**
Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab and cetuximab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of colorectal cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving combin

* Patients who have had anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy within 4 weeks prior to enrollment.
* Patients currently on a corticosteroid dose greater than physiologic replacement dosing defined as 10 mg of cortisone per day or its equivalent.
* Patients with known brain metastases because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
* Patients with signs of liver failure, e.g., clinically significant ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding within 6 months prior to enrollment.
* Prior major liver resection: remnant liver \<50% of the initial liver volume. Patients with a biliary stent can be included.

However, the group is relatively understudied and the potential benefits of increased physical activity to their recovery have not been examined. This study focuses on enhancing recovery by offering a home-based physical activity program to patients who have c
