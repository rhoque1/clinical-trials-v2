# Clinical Biomarker Interpretation Guide
*Compiled from NCCN, ASCO, CAP public guidelines*

## EGFR Mutations (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer)

### Actionable Mutations:
- **Exon 19 deletions** (45% of EGFR mutations)
  - First-line: Osimertinib, Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Afatinib
  - Prognosis: Favorable response to TKIs
  
- **L858R (Exon 21)** (40% of EGFR mutations)
  - First-line: Same as exon 19 deletions
  - Slightly less responsive than exon 19 deletions
  
- **T790M** (resistance mutation)
  - Acquired resistance to 1st/2nd gen TKIs
  - Treatment: Osimertinib (3rd gen TKI)

### Uncommon Mutations:
- Exon 20 insertions (5%): Poor TKI response
- G719X, L861Q, S768I: Respond to 2nd gen TKIs

### Clinical Trial Considerations:
- EGFR+ patients should preferentially enroll in EGFR-targeted trials
- Combination trials: EGFR TKI + chemotherapy/immunotherapy
- Resistance mechanism trials if progression on TKI

## KRAS Mutations

### G12C Mutation:
- **Actionable**: Sotorasib, Adagrasib approved
- Prevalence: 13% of NSCLC, 3-4% of CRC
- Clinical trials: KRAS G12C-specific inhibitors

### Other KRAS Mutations (G12D, G12V, G13D):
- **Not directly targetable** (as of 2024)
- Clinical significance: Poor response to EGFR TKIs
- Trial consideration: Combination strategies, MEK inhibitors

## PD-L1 Expression (Immunotherapy Biomarker)

### Tumor Proportion Score (TPS):
- **≥50%**: High expression
  - First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy approved (NSCLC)
  - Strong predictor of response
  
- **1-49%**: Intermediate expression
  - Consider combination: chemo + immunotherapy
  
- **<1%**: Low/negative
  - Immunotherapy less likely to benefit
  - Consider other biomarkers (TMB, MSI)

### Combined Positive Score (CPS):
- Used in gastric, cervical, HNSCC
- CPS ≥10: Pembrolizumab approved
- CPS ≥1: Consider combination therapy

---

## Microsatellite Instability (MSI) / Mismatch Repair (MMR)

### MSI-High / dMMR:
- **Universal immunotherapy responders**
- Pembrolizumab approved (tumor-agnostic)
- Prevalence: 15% CRC, 30% endometrial, <5% most others
- Clinical trials: All immunotherapy trials

### MSS / pMMR:
- Standard microsatellite stable tumors
- Immunotherapy less effective (except PD-L1 high)

---

## HER2 (ERBB2)

### Breast Cancer:
- **IHC 3+ or FISH amplified**: HER2-positive
  - Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab, T-DM1, T-DXd
  - Excellent prognosis with targeted therapy

### Gastric Cancer:
- HER2+ (10-20% of cases)
- Trastuzumab + chemotherapy

### Emerging: HER2 in Other Cancers
- CRC, NSCLC, Bladder: HER2 amplifications
- Clinical trials: HER2-directed ADCs (T-DXd, T-DM1)

---

## BRAF V600E

### Melanoma:
- **50% of melanomas**
- First-line: Dabrafenib + Trametinib
- Excellent response rates

### Colorectal Cancer:
- **~10% of CRC**
- Poor prognosis marker
- Treatment: BRAF + EGFR inhibitor + chemo
- Clinical trials: Novel BRAF combinations

### NSCLC, Thyroid:
- BRAF inhibitors effective
- Consider combination strategies

---

## ALK Rearrangements

### NSCLC (3-5%):
- First-line: Alectinib, Brigatinib, Lorlatinib
- Excellent long-term outcomes
- Brain metastases: CNS-penetrant ALK inhibitors

---

## ROS1 Rearrangements

### NSCLC (1-2%):
- Crizotinib, Entrectinib approved
- Similar biology to ALK
- Clinical trials: Next-gen ROS1 inhibitors

---

## NTRK Fusions (Tumor-Agnostic)

### Pan-cancer biomarker:
- Larotrectinib, Entrectinib (FDA approved)
- Rare: <1% most cancers, enriched in some pediatric
- Clinical trials: Next-gen TRK inhibitors

---

## PIK3CA Mutations

### Breast Cancer (HR+/HER2-):
- **Alpelisib + Fulvestrant** (FDA approved)
- ~40% of HR+ breast cancers
- Clinical trials: Next-gen PI3K inhibitors

### Other Cancers:
- Emerging target in cervical, head/neck, endometrial
- Clinical trials available

---

## Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)

### TMB-High (≥10 mutations/Mb):
- Pembrolizumab approved (tumor-agnostic)
- Predictor of immunotherapy response
- Independent of PD-L1

---

## Clinical Trial Matching Logic:

1. **Tier 1 (Highest Priority)**:
   - Actionable mutations with FDA-approved drugs
   - Examples: EGFR exon 19 del, ALK+, BRAF V600E, MSI-H

2. **Tier 2 (Clinical Trial Recommended)**:
   - Emerging targets: KRAS G12C, HER2 amplifications, NTRK fusions
   - Resistance mutations: EGFR T790M

3. **Tier 3 (Prognostic/Research)**:
   - TP53, ARID1A, STK11 (no direct therapy)
   - Useful for stratification, clinical trial eligibility
