# Clinical Trials v2.0 - Development Progress

## âœ… Completed Components

### Phase 1: Foundation Architecture (COMPLETE)
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Configuration system (`config/system_config.py`)
- [x] Migrated Clinical Trials API tools (`tools/clinical_trials_api.py`)
- [x] API connectivity verified

### Phase 2: State Machine Framework (COMPLETE)
- [x] Base state machine implementation (`state_machines/base_state_machine.py`)
- [x] Patient Profiler state machine with 5 states (`state_machines/patient_profiler.py`)
- [x] Memory inheritance between states verified
- [x] State transition logic working

### Phase 3: Agent Architecture (COMPLETE)
- [x] Orchestrator for workflow planning (`agents/orchestrator.py`)
- [x] LLM-powered state machine agent (`agents/state_machine_agent.py`)
- [x] LLM + state machine integration verified
- [x] All tests passing

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Full end-to-end workflow with PDF input

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Create PDF extraction tool wrapper
2. Build complete workflow runner
3. Test with real medical report
4. Add trial discovery state machine
5. Implement safety guardrails

- âœ… API tools test: PASSED
- âœ… State machine test: PASSED  
- âœ… Orchestrator test: PASSED
- âœ… LLM integration test: PASSED (using gpt-4o)
